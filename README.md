### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Gopher you've never seen before!

If you're wondering the absence of tests in my packages:
- I tend to not follow the flow, that's for clowns
- You like a package of mine, but you also like tests? Create a pull request with tests added and I'll be happy to approve!
- I have enough experience in coding to avoid huge errors, I'd rather spend time building than testing edge cases
- You are a wonderer and all your life is spent wondering but not doing!

I'm available on Telegram ([@ali_error](https://t.me/ali_error))
